Problem Statement: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Constraints:

Each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Example
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 2 + 7 == 9, so we return [0, 1]

  public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
	  // Solution goes here

    return new int[] {1,2};
  }
